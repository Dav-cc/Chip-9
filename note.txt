chip 8 has 16 8-registers 

V0 to VF are 16 registers and this registers can hold ox00 to oxFF
register VF holds flage to inform about the result of the expression

chip 8 has a 4KB memory and it means 4096 byts from 0x000 to oxFFF
this space devited into three segments :
     1. 0x000 to 0x1FF : reserved for chip 8 intrpreter
     2. 0x050 to 0x0A0 : store 16 built in characters (some roms expecte to we have this segment)
     3. 0x200 to 0xFFF : Instructions from the ROM will be stored starting at 0x200, and anything left after the ROM’s space is free to use.

16 bit index register : is a register that stores memory addresses and caus last memory address is oxFFF 8bit register is so little we make it 16 bit.


16 bit program counter register : As mentioned earlier, the actual program instructions are stored in memory starting at address 0x200.
                                  The CPU needs a way of keeping track of which instruction to execute next.
                                  The Program Counter (PC) is a special register that holds the address of the next instruction to execute.
                                  Again, it’s 16 bits because it has to be able to hold the maximum memory address (0xFFF).


chip 8 stack : A stack is a way for a CPU to keep track of the order of execution when it calls into functions.
               There is an instruction (CALL) that will cause the CPU to begin executing instructions in a different region of the program.
               When the program reaches another instruction (RET), it must be able to go back to where it was when it hit the CALL instruction.
               The stack holds the PC value when the CALL instruction was executed, and the RETURN statement pulls that address from the stack
               and puts it back into the PC so the CPU will execute it on the next cycle.

The CHIP-8 has 16 levels of stack, meaning it can hold 16 different PCs. Multiple levels allow for one function to call another function and so on, until they all return to the original caller site.
Putting a PC onto the stack is called pushing and pulling a PC off of the stack is called popping.
